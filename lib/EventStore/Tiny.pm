=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use EventStore::Tiny;

    my $store = EventStore::Tiny->new;

    # Register event type
    $store->register_event(UserAdded => sub {
        my ($state, $data) = @_;

        # Use $data to inject the new user into the given $state
        $state->{users}{$data->{id}} = {
            name => $data->{name},
        };
    });

    # ...

    # Store an event instance represented by type and data
    $store->store_event(UserAdded => {id => 17, name => 'Bob'});

    # ...

    # Work with the current state snapshot generated by event application
    say 'His name is ' . $store->snapshot->state->{users}{17}{name}; # Bob

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In Event Sourcing, the state of a system is calculated as the application of a stream of events representing each change of the system. This framework is a minimal approach to use these mechanics in simple perl systems and offers these features:

=over 2

=item *

Flexible snapshots (high-resolution timestamps) and event substreams.

=item *

Customizable event logging.

=item *

Simple storage solution for events in the file system.

=item *

Transparent snapshot caching mechanism to improve performance.

=back

The internal state of the system needs to be represented by a simple (nested) hash and all events need to operate on this hash only (by side-effect).

=head1 REFERENCE

EventStore::Tiny implements the following attributes and methods, grouped by topic.

=head2 CONSTRUCTION AND PERSISTENCE

=head3 new

    my $store = EventStore::Tiny->new(init_data => {answer = 42});

Standard constructor. Understands all attributes as arguments. For most use cases, these are the sensible arguments:

=over 4

=item init_data

A hashref representing the initial state. B<Default: C<{}>>

=item init_cache

When this method is called, the cache will be filled.

=item cache_distance

The number of events after a new snapshot is cached for accellerated access. 0 means the cache is updated after each event. undef means the system does not use any caching. B<Default: 0>

=item logger

A subref (callback) which will be called each time an event is applied to the state. The callback gets this event as its only argument. B<Default: L<EventStore::Tiny::Logger/log_cb>>

=item progress_meter

An object of the class L<EventStore::Tiny::ProgressMeter> which defines a callback that is used to report the progress during cache initialization (typically on system startup). B<Default: C<undef>>

=back

=head3 new_from_file

    my $store = EventStore::Tiny->new_from_file($filename);

Deserializes an existing store object which was L</store_to_file>d before.

=head3 store_to_file

    $store->store_to_file($filename);

Serializes the store object to the file system. It can be deserialized via L</new_from_file> later.

=head2 EVENT SOURCING WORKFLOW

=head3 register_event

    $store->register_event(ConnectionRemoved => sub {
        my ($state, $data) = @_;
        # Change $state depending on $data (by side-effect)
    });

Stores an event type in the system by name and action on the C<$state>. Events of this type can be added later to the event store by setting concrete C<$data> with L</store_event>.

=head3 store_event

    $store->store_event(ConnectionRemoved => {id => 42});

Stores a concrete instance of an event type in the event store. The instance is defined by its event type name and a hash of data used by the subref the event uses to manipulate the state.

=head3 snapshot

    my $state1    = $store->snapshot->state;

    my $snapshot  = $store->snapshot(1234217421);
    my $state2    = $snapshot->state;
    my $timestamp = $snapshot->timestamp; # 1234217421

Returns a L<EventStore::Tiny::Snapshot> object which basically consists of the corresponding state of the system (represented by a hashref) and the timestamp of the last used event. Snapshots are selected by the given argument timestamp, which returns the current snapshot at the given time. If no timestamp is given, the snapshot represents the last state of the system.

=head2 INTROSPECTION

=head3 event_names

    my $types = $store->event_names;

Returns an arrayref containing all event type names of registered events, sorted by name. These names are the values of L</registry>.

=head3 registry

    my $user_added = $store->registry->{UserAdded};

Returns a hashref with event type names as keys and event types as values, which are L<EventStore::Tiny::Event> instances. Should be manipulated by L</register_event> only.

=head3 events

    my $event_stream = $store->events;

Returns the internal L<EventStore::Tiny::EventStream> object that stores all concrete events (L<EventStore::Tiny::DataEvent> instances). Should be manipulated by L</store_event> only. Events should never be changed or removed.

=head3 init_state

    my $state = $store->init_state;

Returns a cloned copy of the ininitial state all events are applied on, which was defined by L</init_data> as a hashref.

=head2 OTHER

=head3 is_correct_snapshot

    if ($store->is_correct_snapshot($snapshot)) {
        # ...
    }

Checks if a given L<EventStore::Tiny::Snapshot> instance is a valid snapshot of our L</events> event store. Mostly used for testing.
